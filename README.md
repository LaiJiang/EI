# EI
Predict Causal Genes at GWAS Loci using Machine Learning algorithm

This directory stores codes to implement:
1. how to build summarized genemic features (required by EI) from genomic annotations matrix (provided by users).
2. how to Build prediction model using all 12 traits in EI manuscript (previous one is of 12 models with one trait left out).
3. how to get gene causality predictions using corresponding summarized genomic features (input of EI) and our EI model (trained on all 12 traits in step 2).
